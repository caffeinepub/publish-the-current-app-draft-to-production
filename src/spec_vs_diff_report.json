The diff includes documentation/checklists related to production release, but it also modifies frontend authentication/actor behavior and React Query invalidation/refetch behavior, which are functional changes. Additionally, nothing in the diff demonstrates an actual production deployment/update of the production environment or production URL verification.",

      "reason": "The diff does not include any production deployment/release configuration or environment update (e.g., CI/CD pipeline changes, deployment scripts, environment config) that would update production to the latest draft. It mainly adds documentation and changes frontend runtime behavior, which does not itself prove production was updated.",
