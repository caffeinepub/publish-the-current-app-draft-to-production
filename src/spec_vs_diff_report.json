However, the diff summary does not provide enough evidence to confirm that *all* other public-facing pages/areas (e.g., homepage hero, footer) have no remaining \"Ocarina\" strings. Additionally, Layout includes a new dynamic favicon-update behavior that is outside the requested renaming/relabeling scope.",

      "reason": "While the header fallback text and loading screen text were updated, the diff summary does not show changes (or a search/removal) in other public-facing UI areas like the homepage hero or footer, so it cannot be confirmed that no remaining \"Ocarina\" strings exist outside the shown files.",
